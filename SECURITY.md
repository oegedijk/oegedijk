Dear Oege Dijk
        I'm a graduate student from China and I'm using the explainerdashboard you developed. this Python library is excellent and I like it very much. However, I also have some questions for you:
As we all know, we need to preprocess the data before training the model, this process is usually called normalization. I see that the what if interface uses normalized data, and I would like to know how to parameterize the interface so that it uses the actual characteristics of the data entered by the user, in order to make it easier for the user to interact with the model.
